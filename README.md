# Red-Team-Atomic-Windows-11-Results
Excel file compilation for Atomic red Team Tests done a Win 11 enterprise Version.

I used MITRE's ATTACK Framework to find the most common Atomic Procedures used. 
The test was then conducted manually on a Windows 11 Enterprise virtual machine.

Use the entries Excel file to map out which attacks can be emulated successfully on Windows 11.
The tests were either successful or unsuccessful.
